Project - bike sharing prediction 
Tags - data preprocessing, EDA, encoding, regression, hyperparameter tuning

AIM - We need to create a system which can predict Bike rental demand based on users behaviour.

Process
Importing libraries - 
Data cleaning/wrangling - removing duplicates,dealing with null vals, splitting date column into 3 - date,month,year. Change month vals to Jan,feb etc.
EDA - histograms, pie charts, bar charts, correlation heatmap,pairplot
Model implementation - dummy encoding, train test split,
trying out models- linear reg, ridge, lasso, svr,decision tree,  xgboost regressor
Xgboost regressor works best - 
Hyperparameter tuning - randomized search cv 

Output - implemented xgboost regressor with r2 score of 88.6%
