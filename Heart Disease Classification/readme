Project - Heart disease prediction/classification
AIM - we are give a dataset by a heart doctor based on his visitors. It contains various info about the visitors like age,gender,cholestrol levels etc. we have to create a model that assists the doctor if a visitor has heart disease or not.

Process - 
Data preprocessing - removing duplicates , null vals
EDA - univariate analysis , bivariate [pairplot] , correlation heatmap
Feature Engineering - feature importance - extratrees regressor
Model Building - xgboost classifiers , 
Hyperparameter tuning - gridsearchCV

Output - created xgboost model with 83% accuracy.
